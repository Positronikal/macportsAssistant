BASIC INSTALLATION

These shell utilities work on Macintosh macOS 13 Ventura to automate
some administration of the MacPorts package manager.

Unzip the macportsAssistant download or navigate to the cloned
directory, depending on how you obtained the files from Github. Copy
either the install or upgrade script, since you only need one or the
other, to the directory on your Mac from which you intend to run it.

Edit either the script you copied and change the MacPorts download
target (mpdl) and MacPorts package (mppkg) variables to reflect correct
values for your installation. Here is the package repo URL needed to
determine the correct values:

    https://github.com/macports/macports-base/releases

Edit mpdl with the correct download path, i.e.:

    https://github.com/macports/macports-base/releases/download/v2.8.1/MacPorts-2.8.1-13-Ventura.pkg

And edit mppkg with the correct package name, i.e.:

    MacPorts-2.8.1-13-Ventura.pkg

You will need to use sudo, so run either:

    $ sudo macports_assistant_install.sh

...or if you already have a version of MacPorts for a previous macOS
version...

    $ sudo macports_assistant_upgrade.sh

Once either completes, you'll have a ~/bin/MacPorts directory with an
update utility in the ~/bin directory. This directory will also be
added to your path envar and it can be called from the terminal using
sudo from that point.
